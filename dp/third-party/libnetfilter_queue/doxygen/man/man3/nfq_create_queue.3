.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Once libnetfilter_queue library has been initialised (See \fBLibrarySetup\fP), it is possible to bind the program to a specific queue\&. This can be done by using \fBnfq_create_queue()\fP\&.
.PP
The queue can then be tuned via \fBnfq_set_mode()\fP or \fBnfq_set_queue_maxlen()\fP\&.
.PP
Here's a little code snippet that create queue numbered 0: 
.PP
.nf
        printf("binding this socket to queue '0'\n");
        qh = nfq_create_queue(h,  0, &cb, NULL);
        if (!qh) {
                fprintf(stderr, "error during nfq_create_queue()\n");
                exit(1);
        }

        printf("setting copy_packet mode\n");
        if (nfq_set_mode(qh, NFQNL_COPY_PACKET, 0xffff) < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "can't set packet_copy mode\n");
                exit(1);
        }

.fi
.PP
.PP
Next step is the handling of incoming packets which can be done via a loop:
.PP
.PP
.nf
        fd = nfq_fd(h);

        while ((rv = recv(fd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0)) >= 0) {
                printf("pkt received\n");
                nfq_handle_packet(h, buf, rv);
        }
.fi
.PP
 When the decision on a packet has been choosed, the verdict has to be given by calling \fBnfq_set_verdict()\fP or \fBnfq_set_verdict2()\fP\&. The verdict determines the destiny of the packet as follows:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
NF_DROP discarded the packet
.IP "\(bu" 2
NF_ACCEPT the packet passes, continue iterations
.IP "\(bu" 2
NF_QUEUE inject the packet into a different queue (the target queue number is in the high 16 bits of the verdict)
.IP "\(bu" 2
NF_REPEAT iterate the same cycle once more
.IP "\(bu" 2
NF_STOP accept, but don't continue iterations
.PP
.PP
The verdict NF_STOLEN must not be used, as it has special meaning in the kernel\&. When using NF_REPEAT, one way to prevent re-queueing of the same packet is to also set an nfmark using nfq_set_verdict2, and set up the nefilter rules to only queue a packet when the mark is not (yet) set\&.
.PP
Data and information about the packet can be fetch by using message parsing functions (See \fBParsing\fP)\&.

.PP 
.SS "struct nfq_q_handle* nfq_create_queue (struct nfq_handle *h, uint16_tnum, nfq_callback *cb, void *data)"
nfq_create_queue - create a new queue handle and return it\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIh\fP Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to \fBnfq_open()\fP 
.br
\fInum\fP the number of the queue to bind to 
.br

.br
\fIdata\fP custom data to pass to the callback function
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
a nfq_q_handle pointing to the newly created queue
.RE
.PP
Creates a new queue handle, and returns it\&. The new queue is identified by \fBnum\fP, and the callback specified by \fBcb\fP will be called for each enqueued packet\&. The \fBdata\fP argument will be passed unchanged to the callback\&. If a queue entry with id \fBnum\fP already exists, this function will return failure and the existing entry is unchanged\&.
.PP
The nfq_callback type is defined in libnetfilter_queue\&.h as: 
.PP
.nf
typedef int nfq_callback(struct nfq_q_handle *qh,
                         struct nfgenmsg *nfmsg,
                         struct nfq_data *nfad, void *data);

.fi
.PP
.PP
Parameters:
.IP "\(bu" 2
qh The queue handle returned by nfq_create_queue
.IP "\(bu" 2
nfmsg message objetc that contains the packet
.IP "\(bu" 2
nfad Netlink packet data handle
.IP "\(bu" 2
data the value passed to the data parameter of nfq_create_queue
.PP
.PP
The callback should return < 0 to stop processing\&.

.SS "int nfq_set_queue_flags (struct nfq_q_handle *qh, uint32_tmask, uint32_tflags)"
nfq_set_queue_flags - set flags (options) for the kernel queue 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIqh\fP Netfilter queue handle obtained by call to \fBnfq_create_queue()\fP\&. 
.br
\fImask\fP specifies which flag bits to modify 
.br
\fIflags\fP bitmask of flags
.RE
.PP
Existing flags, that you may want to combine, are:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
NFQA_CFG_F_FAIL_OPEN (requires Linux kernel >= 3\&.6): the kernel will accept the packets if the kernel queue gets full\&. If this flag is not set, the default action in this case is to drop packets\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
NFQA_CFG_F_CONNTRACK (requires Linux kernel >= 3\&.6): the kernel will include the Connection Tracking system information\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
NFQA_CFG_F_GSO (requires Linux kernel >= 3\&.10): the kernel will not normalize offload packets, i\&.e\&. your application will need to be able to handle packets larger than the mtu\&.
.PP
Normalization is expensive, so this flag should always be set\&. Because attributes in netlink messages are limited to 65531 bytes, you also need to check the NFQA_CAP_LEN attribute, it contains the original size of the captured packet on the kernel side\&. If it is set and differs from the payload length, the packet was truncated\&. This also happens when limiting capture size with the NFQNL_COPY_PACKET setting, or when e\&.g\&. a local user sends a very large packet\&.
.PP
If your application validates checksums (e\&.g\&., tcp checksum), then you must also check if the NFQA_SKB_INFO attribute is present\&. If it is, you need to test the NFQA_SKB_CSUMNOTREADY bit: 
.PP
.nf
        if (attr[NFQA_SKB_INFO]) {
                uint32_t info = ntohl(mnl_attr_get_u32(attr[NFQA_SKB_INFO]));
                if (info & NFQA_SKB_CSUMNOTREADY)
                        validate_checksums = false;
        }

.fi
.PP
 if this bit is set, the layer 3/4 checksums of the packet appear incorrect, but are not (because they will be corrected later by the kernel)\&. Please see example/nf-queue\&.c in the libnetfilter_queue source for more details\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
NFQA_CFG_F_UID_GID: the kernel will dump UID and GID of the socket to which each packet belongs\&.
.PP

.PP
.PP
Here's a little code snippet to show how to use this API: 
.PP
.nf
        uint32_t flags = NFQA_CFG_F_FAIL_OPEN;
        uint32_t mask = NFQA_CFG_F_FAIL_OPEN;

        printf("Enabling fail-open on this q\n");
        err = nfq_set_queue_flags(qh, mask, flags);

        printf("Disabling fail-open on this q\n");
        flags &= ~NFQA_CFG_F_FAIL_OPEN;
        err = nfq_set_queue_flags(qh, mask, flags);

.fi
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
NFQA_CFG_F_SECCTX: the kernel will dump security context of the socket to which each packet belongs\&.
.PP
.PP
\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
When fragmentation occurs and NFQA_CFG_F_GSO is NOT set then the kernel dumps UID/GID and security context fields only for one fragment\&. To deal with this limitation always set NFQA_CFG_F_GSO\&.
